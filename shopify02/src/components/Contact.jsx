          Tikvah Ethiopia means Hope of Ethiopia. Our channel is working mainly
          on three basic issues. The first is to provide timely and reliable
          information to its family, thereby contributing to the fact that our
          Chanelâ€™s family is not deceived by false information. The second is
          charity work, which has been done to help and protect many of our
          infirm people by coordinating with our families. The last and third is
          to empower young people. In this way, it is working to inspire young
          people to strive for a good cause and to create enlightenment among
          this generation.
